# Sudoku Solver

This is a Python implementation of the backtracking algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles. The algorithm is implemented in the solve() function, which takes a 2D array representing the Sudoku board as input. Empty cells are represented as 0.

## Usage

To use the solver, you will need to provide a 2D array representing the Sudoku board as input to the solve() function. Here's an example of how you can use the solver to solve a Sudoku puzzle:

board = [[5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
         [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
         [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
         [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
         [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]]

solve(board)

The solve() function will return True if a solution is found and False if the board is unsolvable. The solved board will be stored in the same 2D array that was passed in as input.

You can also use the print_board() function to print the solved board in a more readable format.

print_board(board)

## Additional functions
* The valid() function is used to check if a given number is a valid solution for a specific cell in the Sudoku board. It checks if the number is already present in the same row, column or 3x3 subgrid of the cell.
* The find_empty() function is used to find the next empty cell in the board. It returns the position (row, col) of the empty cell.

## Note
This code is provided as an example and for educational purposes. It may not work for all the sudoku puzzles, and there may be other ways to optimize or improve the performance of the backtracking algorithm.
